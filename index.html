			<p>Hello folks! My name is Annie Crimson. In this website, I'll be posting footage of some tapes that had arrive at my place a few days 
			ago since it looked quite interesting. I will also be posting videos and photos on documentaries and my discussions about these tapes 
			with other people.</p>
		
		<h2><center>Recording 10_08_2010</center></h2>
			<center><video controls src="Recording 10_08_2010.mp4" width="500px">

			</video></center>
			<center><p>This was a recording I found on a phone that was also in the box. There was a cut in the middle of the recording, and sadly 
			I wasn't able to retrieve it. But here's one thing off about the phone. It's year was set to 2011. No matter how much I tried to change it 
			to 2018, it'll change back to 2011.</p></center>
		<h2><center>Voice Message</center></h2>
			<center><video controls src="Voice Message.mp4" width="500px">

			</video></center>
			<center><p>This was a call recording from my end to a phone number in the box. Although, it immediately went to voice-message. So sadly 
			I wasn't able to get any information regarding the things sent to me.</p></center>
